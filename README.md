# OpenCon

This repository hosts my applications to [OpenCon2016](www.opencon2016.org), [OpenCon2017](http://www.opencon2017.org/), and [OpenCon2018](https://www.opencon2018.org/).

I was very lucky to attend OpenCon 2016 (thank you OHSU Library for sponsoring my attendance!) and I hope to attend again this year. OpenCon is a diverse and vibrant community of change catalyzers that I am honored to be part of. If you have not applied yet, DO IT NOW [here]( https://apply.opencon2017.org/referral/SuQBr)! Applications are due on August 1st, 2017.

*"OpenCon is more than a conference. It’s a platform for the next generation to learn about Open Access, Open Education, and Open Data, develop critical skills, and catalyze action toward a more open system for sharing the world’s information—from scholarly and scientific research, to educational materials, to digital research data.* - From the OpenCon About Us page. 

### Update June 12, 2018  
I actually did not end up attending OpenCon 2017, but I did make it to the wait list. I had made it clear that I could not have attended the conference without full financial support. It was also tricky for me because two months before the dates for OpenCon 2017 were made public, I had committed to attend and present at a large research conference in my field, Society for Neuroscience, which for some unknown and unfortunate reasons tends to always overlap with OpenCon. 

In any case, if you are thinking about applying to attend [OpenCon2018](http://www.opportunitydesk.org/2018/06/12/opencon-2018-in-toronto-canada/) in Toronto, stop thinking and APPLY NOW!
