# OpenCon

This repository hosts my applications to [OpenCon2016](www.opencon2016.org) and [OpenCon2017](http://www.opencon2017.org/).

I was very lucky to attend OpenCon 2016 (thank you OHSU Library for sponsoring my attendance!) and I hope to attend again this year. OpenCon is a diverse and vibrant community of change catalyzers that I am honored to be part of. If you have not applied yet, DO IT NOW [here](https://apply.opencon2017.org/apply-2017/)! Applications are due on August 1st, 2017.

*"OpenCon is more than a conference. It’s a platform for the next generation to learn about Open Access, Open Education, and Open Data, develop critical skills, and catalyze action toward a more open system for sharing the world’s information—from scholarly and scientific research, to educational materials, to digital research data.* - From the OpenCon About Us page.
