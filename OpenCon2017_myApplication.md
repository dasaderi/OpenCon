## Daniela Saderi - OpenCon 2017 Application

#### Who are you? Please provide a brief biography about yourself. This may include what you do for work, what you study, what projects youâ€™re involved in, or what you are passionate about. Maximum 700 characters (~100 words).
I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Neuroscience at Oregon Health and Science University. In addition to working full time on my dissertation 
project, I organize and lead activities aimed to promote self-development and community building. I am an OpenCon alum, ASAPbio Ambassador, 
and Mozilla Science Open Leader, and I advocate for open-science practices and transparency in research. I recently joined a team of 
outstanding women as fundraising steering committee member for Women in Science Portland, an organization that strives to build a community of supportive networks for the development, retention, and promotion of women in the sciences.

#### Why are you interested in OpenCon? In your own words, tell us why you are interested in Open Access, Open Education and/or Open Data and how these issues relate to your work. If you are already working on these issues please tell us how. Maximum 1400 characters (~200 words).

Open is the way science should be! The collective benefits of scientific transparency vastly outweigh the short-term gains resulting from selfish control of scientific output, but current policies are not enabling openness as they could. I want to work towards the development of standards in which openly sharing scientific outputs is the default and indicative of high quality science.  
Professionally and personally, OpenCon 2016 was a life changing experience. Besides making me realize that conferences can be inclusive and excel due to the collaborative spirit of many people, OpenCon gave me the unique opportunity to become part of a community of change catalyzers. Thank to the OpenCon network, I met several people with whom I currently collaborate on open science projects.  
For the past two years I have worked with Robin Champieux, scholarly communicator librarian at the OHSU Library, and other scientists at the [OpenInsight Project](http://openinsightpdx.com/) to organize events that aim to develop skills and raise awareness among academics around issues of open science. Our group collaborates with non-scientists and other members of the Portland community to organize events such as Science Hack Day PDX aimed to bring together people with different skills and backgrounds to work on art/science/hacky projects and learn from one another in a fun environment. 
 

#### What are your ideas for advancing Open Access, Open Education and/or Open Data? The biggest goal of OpenCon is to catalyze action to advance Open Access, Open Education and Open Data. Tell us what ideas you have for taking action on these issues, and how you would use (or are currently using) your experience with OpenCon to have an impact. Maximum 1400 characters (~200 words).
To advance openness in science and education, first we need to learn about the obstacles that it faces. To that end, Amie Fairs and I have been developing the [Why Not Open Science? project](https://github.com/dasaderi/WhyNotOpenScience) as part of the Mozilla Open Leadership training. Our project aims to develop a survey to help assess researchers' attitudes towards open science (OS) and learn about the barriers preventing them from adopting OS standards in their routines. The goal is to distribute the survey to researchers all around the globe and then use the results to inform current OS training materials and institutional policies.  
Another problem that many are working to solve is the current standard for publication models and the way scientific papers are reviewed. Samantha Hindle and I are working on the [Preprint Journal Club project](https://github.com/SamanthaHindle/preprint_JournalClub), to facilitate the incorporation of preprints into journal clubs at research institutions around the world. By encouraging the reading and evaluation of preprints among groups of scientists, we hope to increase the awareness and usage of preprints. So far we have run an opinion survey to gather input from the community, secured funding for the project, and are in the process of partnering with other groups to develop a PreprintJC web platform.
