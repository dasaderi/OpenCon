## Daniela Saderi - OpenCon 2017 Application

#### Who are you? Please provide a brief biography about yourself. This may include what you do for work, what you study, what projects youâ€™re involved in, or what you are passionate about. Maximum 700 characters (~100 words).
I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Neuroscience at Oregon Health and Science University. In addition to working full time on my dissertation 
project, I organize and lead activities aimed to promote self-development and community building. I am an OpenCon alum, ASAPbio Ambassador, 
and Mozilla Science Open Leader, and I advocate for open-science practices and transparency in research. I recently joined a team of 
outstanding women as fundraising steering committee member for Women in Science Portland, an organization that strives to build a community 
of supportive networks for the development, retention, and promotion of women in the sciences.

#### Why are you interested in OpenCon? In your own words, tell us why you are interested in Open Access, Open Education and/or Open Data and how these issues relate to your work. If you are already working on these issues please tell us how. Maximum 1400 characters (~200 words).
 
Open is the way science should be! The individual and collective rewards associated with transparency largely outweigh the selfish control 
of scientific output. I want to work towards the development of policy and standards in which openly sharing scientific outputs is the 
default and indicative of high quality science. 
Professionally and personally, OpenCon 2016 was a life changing experience that I wish to repeat. Besides making me realize that 
conferences can be inclusive and excel due to the collaborative spirit of many people, OpenCon gave me the unique opportunity to become 
part of a community of change catalyzers. Thank to the OpenCon network, I met several people with whom I currently collaborate on open 
science projects.
Locally, in the past two years I have been working with Robin Champieux from the OHSU library and other scientists at the [Open Insight 
Project](http://openinsightpdx.com/) organizing events that specifically aim to develop skills and raise awareness among academics around 
issues of open science. Our group also collaborates with non-scientists and other members of the extended Portland communities to organize 
events such as [Science Hack Day PDX](http://portland.sciencehackday.org/) aimed to bring together people with different skills and 
backgrounds to work on art/science/hacky projects and learn from each other in a fun environment. 

#### What are your ideas for advancing Open Access, Open Education and/or Open Data? The biggest goal of OpenCon is to catalyze action to advance Open Access, Open Education and Open Data. Tell us what ideas you have for taking action on these issues, and how you would use (or are currently using) your experience with OpenCon to have an impact. Maximum 1400 characters (~200 words).
At OpenCon 2016 I met Amie Fairs with whom I carried out the [Why Not Open Science? project](https://github.com/dasaderi/WhyNotOpenScience) 
through the last Mozilla Open Leadership training. This projects aims to develop and disseminate a survey to help assess researchers' 
attitudes towards open science (OS) and learn about the barriers preventing them from adopting OS standards in their routines. 
Our goal is to distribute the survey to researchers all around the globe and then use the results to inform current OS training materials 
and institutional policies.

At the [Mozilla Science miniWOW](https://daniellecrobinson.github.io/mini-wow-pdx/) I helped organized here in Portland, I met Samantha 
Hindle, also ASAPbio Ambassador and OS advocate, with whom I am currently working on the 
[Preprint Journal Club Starter Kit project](https://github.com/SamanthaHindle/preprint_JournalClub). We are developing practical 
resources to encourage the incorporation of preprints into journal clubs at research institutions around the world. By encouraging 
the reading and evaluation of preprints among groups of scientists, we hope to increase the awareness, usage, and value of preprints, 
particularly in the biological sciences. So far we have run an opinion survey to gather input from the community, secured funding for 
the project, and are in the process of partnering with other groups to develop a PreprintJC web platform.
