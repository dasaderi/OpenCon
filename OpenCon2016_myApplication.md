## Daniela Saderi - OpenCon 2016 Application

#### Describe yourself in 1-2 sentences.
 
I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Neuroscience Graduate Program at Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU). 
I am passionate about research and making data available to everyone to advance knowledge and improve transparency.
 
#### Why are you interested in Open Access, Open Education and/or Open Data and how does it relate to your work? If you are already involved in these issues, tell us how. (~250 words)
 
As a scientist, I am aware of the importance of collaboration to advance knowledge. However, opportunities to establish 
inter-disciplinary connections are sometimes hard to come across. In the summer of 2015, I was lucky to be one of twenty 
students and postdocs recruited to participate to the Summer Workshop on the Dynamic Brain, organized by the Allen Institute for 
Brain Science and the University of Washington. The purpose of the workshop went beyond teaching a bunch of scholars how to handle data; 
it made me truly understand the importance of sharing ideas and having an open attitude in science.  
 
Inspired to practice open science advocacy, I came back to my institution and engaged in a new project sponsored by the OHSU Library 
and funded by the National Institute of Health called Open Insight (http://openinsightpdx.com/). Together with librarians, scholarly 
communicators, and other students, we organize events that specifically aim to develop skills and raise awareness around issues of open 
science practices through hands-on learning and conversations with leaders in the field.  
 
To continue our mission and further emphasize the importance of inclusion and sharing, our team has connected with other open science 
advocates outside of OHSU to organize a Science Hack Day here in Portland (http://portland.sciencehackday.org/). 
Science Hack Day is an inclusive event where scientists, developers, and designers (and anyone who wants to take up on the challenge!) 
are brought together in the same space to build something useful, creative, or simply fun.

#### The biggest goal of OpenCon is to catalyze action. What ideas do you have for advancing Open Access, Open Education and/or Open Data, and how would you use your experience at OpenCon to have an impact? (~250 words)
 
Even though still in its infancy, my commitment to openness has recently evolved into a life mission. 
I dream of a world where decisions are made upon understanding of facts and consequences, and where complexity and opaqueness 
are not tools to power inequalities.
 
A problem that I feel strongly about is the lack of transparency around healthcare issues. In an era where data can be easily shared, 
I simply refuse to accept that there is not a better way to inform people about their options for treatments and associated costs.
I grew up in a country where access to healthcare is a human right and most citizens take it for granted. When I arrived in the United 
States, the “pre-existing condition” excuse was still used to deny people access to care. During my first encounter with the American 
medical system, it took me more than ten minutes to explain to the hospital assistant that I did not have insurance prior to coming to 
OHSU not because of poor judgment, but because “we simply do not have health insurances in Italy”.
 
I want to be part of the team of people that believe that change can occur through transparency. Making health care data available could 
have a tremendous impact on how healthcare is managed in this country. For instance, it could lead to the development of tools that can 
accurately estimate in advance the price of a medical procedure. This simple action could empower people with the ability to make informed 
decisions and have a say on one of the most important human rights: the right to be healthy.

#### Comments Box (Optional). Use this box for any additional information you would like to share about yourself, projects you work on, or other information that could impact your attendance or participation at OpenCon 2016, if invited. Maximum 900 characters, ~150 words.
 
I am fortunate to be a member of a laboratory where open attitudes towards science are the norm. My PI, Stephen David, encourages 
inter- and intra-disciplinary collaborations and promotes open-science action. He is also the founder of Neurotree (http://neurotree.org) 
a collaborative, open-access website that tracks and visualizes the academic genealogy and history of neuroscience.

With the technical help of an experienced postdoc in the lab, Brad Buran, and the support of my PI, I have started an OHSU Python Club 
where anyone excited about learning Python is invited to meet weekly. The Python programming language is rapidly becoming the symbol of 
transparency and reproducibility in science, and we want to fully embrace their mission.
 
I would be honored to participate to OpenCon and I would be excited about bringing back to my community more knowledge and enthusiasm 
around the open science practice.
